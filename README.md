# 30 in 30: Day 1

## Mindful - A meditaton web app

This is the first web app in the 30 web apps in 30 days series.

# Requirements for Series

- Build from scratch
- Start with an idea
- Do some research (as needed)
- Build the app
- Add a Readme and document what I learned
- Make it open source for the community

## App Requirements

1. Timers - 3 min, 5 min, 10 min, possibility to add more
2. Simple to use - Clean UI with no distractions
3. Mobile friendly - a must as I intend to use it on my phone
4. Sounds for mindfulness
5. Sound when timer ends - must gradually increase in sound over 30 seconds to break gradually from the meditation
6. Start/Stop controls

## What I Learned

- the ^ shortcut in mac is the `control` key, always guessed around - super simple now I will remember.
- Windows VSCode with GitBash is a pain, permission errors due to WindowsApps
- pythons simple http server works fine but wont bind to eth0 for some reason, I need to check this Win machine
- need to cover arrow functions as they are more compact
- window.onload vs document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {});
- document.title for changing the window title top, nice for alerts
